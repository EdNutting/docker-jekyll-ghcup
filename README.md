# docker-jekyll-ghcup

GHC-Up on jekyll/builder (on Alpine Linux)

See [ednutting/jekyll-ghcup on Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ednutting/jekyll-ghcup)

See my other repositories for GHC, Stack and Agda on Jekyll/builder.

Note: Give your Docker instance 4 CPUs and 8GB RAM minimum or the build may randomly fail.
